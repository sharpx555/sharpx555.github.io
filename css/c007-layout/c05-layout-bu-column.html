    <div>The Curtis brothers, from oldest to youngest are Darrel (20), Sodapop (16) and Ponyboy (14). Their parents died in a car accident 8 months ago, so Darrel takes care of his two little brothers. According to close friend Keith Matthew, the boys were devasted when they heard of their parent's tragedy. Now, there have been talks of sending Soda and Pony to a boy's home, but interviews have found that the three brothers are doing everything they could to stay together. Darrel has been selected for a scholarship to play football in college, but with no money and time, he had to turn it down. Sodapop is a school dropout, now supporting the family by working at a DX station. We can only tell in the upcoming days if the boys are being separated as Ponyboy is going to court for running away from home.</div>
